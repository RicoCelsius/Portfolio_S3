# Proof
## Methodology Awareness and Understanding and Agile Implementation in Projects
In the individual project as in the group project, we used SCRUM. For the individual project we created 1 user story and for the group project we created multiple user stories. Before the sprint started we held refinement meetings with the client. We held these refinement meetings to determine which tasks were important for the sprint and to clarify any uncertainties with the client. We then used an online sprint poker tool to assign points to the backlog items. After the points were assigned, we assigned tasks to everyone. Then we often did pair programming, to learn from each other and to check each other. Before the day starts we have a daily stand-up, to hear from everyone what they have done, what they have encountered, and whether anyone needs extra help to get something done.
