# Learning outcome 6: Translate Requirements and Validate Designs Using Multiple Test Techniques
## In short:
You translate (non-functional) requirements to extend existing (architectural) designs and can validate them using multiple types of test techniques.

### Requirements Translation and Design Extension:
The ability to extend existing designs based on new requirements, especially non-functional ones like security and performance, is crucial. This includes:

- **Understanding and Translating Requirements**: You interpret and convert (non-functional) requirements into actionable design extensions, enhancing the existing architecture of the software.
- **Design Evaluation**: You assess the quality of these designs, considering the stipulated quality properties.

### Validation through Testing and Feedback:
Validating the quality and efficacy of your designs is key, using:

- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: This involves real users testing the software to ensure it meets their needs and expectations.
- **Stakeholder Feedback**: Gathering feedback from stakeholders to ascertain if the software aligns with their expectations and requirements.
- **Quality Property Testing**: You also evaluate the design by testing or prototyping, focusing on quality properties like security and performance.
