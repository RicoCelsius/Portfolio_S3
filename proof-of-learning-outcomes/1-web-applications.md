# Learning outcome 1: Web applications.
## In short: 
You design and build user-friendly, full-stack web applications.
### User friendly:
User-friendly software applications are crafted with the user's needs at the forefront, ensuring they are straightforward to comprehend, navigate, and utilize. You want you UI to be straightforward to use. This means users can interact with it without encountering significant challenges or confusion. It implies that the application's design and functionality are intuitive and do not require a steep learning curve.
You apply basic User experience testing and development techniques. 
### Full-stack:
You design and build a full stack application using commonly accepted front end (Javascript-based framework) and back end techniques (e.g. Object Relational Mapping) choosing and implementing relevant communication protocols and addressing asynchronous communication issues.
Full-stack applications are like complete meals. In the world of web development, they include two main parts:
- Front-End: This is the part you see and interact with on a website, like buttons, forms, and text. It's like the menu you look at in a restaurant.
- Back-End: This is the behind-the-scenes part that does the work. It's like the kitchen in a restaurant, where the food is prepared, and orders are managed.
