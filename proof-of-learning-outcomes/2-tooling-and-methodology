# Learning outcome 2: Use Software Tooling and Methodology for Continuous Software Quality Improvement
## In short:
You use software tooling and methodology that continuously monitors and improves the software quality during software development.

### Tooling and Methodology:
In software development, the quality of the software is just as important as its functionality. This requires a continuous process of monitoring and improvement. Key practices include:

- **Unit, Integration, Regression, and System Testing**: You conduct various types of tests to ensure each part of your code works individually (unit testing) and together (integration testing). Regression testing checks if new changes have disrupted anything that used to work, while system testing evaluates the software as a whole.
- **Security and Performance Considerations**: You don't just test for functionality but also keep an eye on how secure and efficient the software is.
- **Static Code Analysis**: This is like a grammar check for your code, where you use tools to analyze your code for potential errors, code smells, and inefficiencies without actually running the program.
- **Code Reviews**: You regularly review code with peers to catch mistakes, learn from each other, and ensure the code adheres to the project's standards and best practices.
