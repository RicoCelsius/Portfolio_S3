# Learning outcome 4: Implement a (Semi-)Automated Software Release Process
## In short:
You implement a (semi-)automated software release process that matches the needs of the project context.

### Implementation:
In the modern software development lifecycle, automating the release process is crucial for efficiency and reliability. It involves setting up systems that handle the integration and deployment of new code changes automatically. Key aspects include:

- **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)**: You set up a CI/CD pipeline using tools like GitLab CI and Docker. This involves automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors and ensuring that the software is reliably released to production without manual intervention.
- **Docker**: You use Docker to create containers that package your software with all its dependencies, making it easy to deploy consistently across any environment.
