# Portfolio Semester 3


## Introduction
Welcome to my Semester 3 portfolio! In this portfolio, I will showcase the work and projects I have completed during my third semester.

## Organisation

In this section, I will provide an overview of the organization of this portfolio. I have divided it into two main sections:

### Individual Project
For my individual project, you can explore the code and documentation on my GitHub repository:

### Group Project
In collaboration with my fellow students, we worked on a group project. You can find the project code and related materials on the group project's GitHub repository:

## Documentation
This section will contain detailed documentation for both the group project and the individual project. Documentation is a crucial aspect of software development, and I believe in providing clear and comprehensive documentation to enhance understanding and usability.
