## Introduction
Welcome to my Semester 3 portfolio! In this portfolio, I will showcase the work and projects I have completed during my third semester.
In this portfolio, I explain my learning outcomes and how I was able to demonstrate the learning outcomes. This portfolio will contain references to the projects created. Another seperate repository has been created for the documentation.
For my individual project, I worked with [Martijn](https://github.com/Martijn-19).

### Individual Project
For my individual project, you can explore the code on our GitHub repository:
To run this project. See the readme inside the repository.

### Group Project
In collaboration with my fellow students, we worked on a group project. You can find the project code and related materials on the group project's GitHub repository:

## Documentation
This section will contain detailed documentation for both the group project and the individual project. Documentation is a crucial aspect of software development, and I believe in providing clear and comprehensive documentation to enhance understanding and usability.
